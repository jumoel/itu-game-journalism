Review: Super Crate Box
=========================

**By [Julian MÃ¸ller](mailto:julian@julianmoeller.dk)**

  * Formal stuff
  	* Platform
	* price
	* release date
  * Screenshot 
  * Short intro to grab attention
  	* Describe casual/hardcore
	* What are the good parts.
	* What are the bad parts.
  * Proper review
  	* Casual vs Hardcore
	* Controls. Fine for beginning, awkward for 1337 play
	* Progression: Levels, the fact that you get better feels great. A bit of luck, but not much.
	* Unlocks (trend with other indie game characters)
	* Balancing
	* Lack of proper tutorial (monsters become red when the get dropped into fire)
	* Too much success - no updates even though promised
  * Score (thumbs up -- so low price that a 'proper' score doesn't make sense, lots of value for 6 DKK)
