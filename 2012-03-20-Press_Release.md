Maxis and the municipality of Copenhagen, Denmark, join forces with city planning in Sim City
=============================================================================================

**COPENHAGEN, Denmark, March 20th, 2012** ---- The future is here! Maxis today announced that the next
edition of the city simulation series Sim City, is so advanced that it will be used in the planning
works of a real city, allowing the city to save dozens of suitcases of money.

Today the municipality of Copenhagen, Denmark, in collaboration with Maxis announced, that the entire
city council of Copenhagen has received early beta access for the forthcoming city simulator "Sim City".
The beta access will be used to cut expenses and administration, by using the game to determine the best
courses of action to take when deciding what to expand, build and demolish in the Nordic metropolis.

The municipality of Copenhagen has dire needs to save money, so it looked for innovative solutions,
that could reduce bureacracy and spending as well. When the municipality approached Maxis, they quickly
discovered that this would be a good match.

"The simulation in Sim City proved to be so precise and acted so much like a real city that we decided to
give it a testdrive", said Frank Jensen, mayor of Copenhagen. "When toll booths proved to be a bad idea
even in Sim City, we discovered that we could avoid a lot of bad decisions simply by playing games all day."

Maxis is thrilled that their new game is being used for other things than fun. "That our city simulator can
be used in the decision making process in an *actually* city, is a great accomplishment. Our team of programmers
have been partying around the clock because of their feat," said Sandip Das, CEO of Maxis. "Our marketing
department is drafting new campaigns as we speak, touting this accomplishment."
