Maxis and the municipality of Copenhagen, Denmark, join forces with city planning using Sim City
================================================================================================

**COPENHAGEN, Denmark, March 20th, 2012** ---- The future is here! Maxis, a subsidiary of Electronic Arts,
today announced that the next edition of the city simulation series Sim City, is so advanced that it will
be used in the planning works of a real city, allowing the city to save dozens of suitcases of money.

Today the municipality of Copenhagen, Denmark, in collaboration with Maxis announced, that the entire
city council of Copenhagen has received early beta access for the forthcoming city simulator "Sim City".
The beta access will be used to cut expenses and administration, by using the game to determine the best
courses of action to take when deciding what to expand, build and demolish in the Nordic metropolis.

The municipality of Copenhagen has dire needs to save money, so it looked for innovative solutions,
that could reduce bureacracy and spending as well. When the municipality approached Maxis, they quickly
discovered that this would be a good match.

"The simulation in Sim City proved to be so precise and acted so much like a real city that we decided to
give it a testdrive", said Frank Jensen, Lord Mayor of Copenhagen. "When toll booths proved to be a bad idea
even in Sim City, we discovered that we could avoid a lot of bad decisions simply by playing games all day.
We believe we can evolve Copenhagen in major ways with this new tool."

Maxis is thrilled that their new game is being used for other things than fun. "That our city simulator can
be used in the decision making process in an *actually* city, is a great accomplishment. Our team of programmers
have been partying around the clock because of their accomplishment," said John Riccitiello, CEO of Electronic Arts.
"Our marketing department is drafting new campaigns as we speak, touting the accomplishment."

The work to reduce the spending and close down several of the departments in the offices of the municipality will
formally begin in April, but select high payed workers have already been laid off. Their replacements will be Sim
City afficionados, who in will be responsible for all counceling and guidance with regards to the future development
of Copenhagen. The use of Sim City will allow the municipality to view city planning in a new light, and will help
bring Copenhagen into the top tier of the metropolises of the world.

If the project proves succesful, it will be expanded to encompass all major Danish cities within the next couple of
years.
