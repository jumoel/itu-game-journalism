# Synopsis for Game Journalism Exam Project


*Julian Møller ([jumo@itu.dk](mailto:jumo@itu.dk))*

My exam project will be part feature story and part review.

The target media will be a mainstream newspaper like Politiken or Berlingske.

The topic will be the increasing need for games for 'adults' who have obligations (jobs, studies, children, etc), but still wants to play games. The games need to be less reliant on twitch reflexes, excessive grind, regular practice and other time consuming practices.

I will discuss what I think makes certain games good for ‘gamers with jobs.’ I will bring examples of games, that fulfill the criterions, such as Naughty Dog’s Uncharted series and Quantic Dream’s Heavy Rain. I will discuss what shortcomings games of this type might have compared to ‘regular’ games and whether or not those shortcomings are worth it.

I will also discuss these games as the movielike experiences they undoubtedly are.

I will bring in references to other articles on the subject, if I can find any. I haven’t really looked for them that much yet. I will of course use my own experiences in the article, but I will also bring in the experiences of others in situations like my own: Infatuated by games, but simply don’t have the time to play as much as they’d like or maybe at all. What (types of) games move them and what makes them find time in their calendars.

I think a discussion and review of this type of games is relevant - especially as my generation (and the people a bit older than me) grow even older. We grew up with games, but now we are becoming proper adults with busy schedules and the time available for gaming lessen.

I have not yet decided on target language - yet. But I’m thinking it will probably be in English.
